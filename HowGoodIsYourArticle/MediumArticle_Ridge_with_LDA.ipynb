      "MediumEveryone’s stories and ideasAug 2, 2015 UnlistedAmendment to Medium Terms of Service Applicable to U.S. Government UsersThis agreement (“Amendment”) is an amendment to Medium’s Terms. It is between Medium and the U.S. Government and applies to the use of Medium Services by the Government.The reason for this Amendment is that, as a U.S. Government entity (“you“ or “Agency”), you must follow federal laws and regulations when entering into a binding agreement such as Medium’s Terms. The subjects of these rules are broad and include ethics, privacy and security, accessibility, federal records, limitations on indemnification, fiscal law constraints, advertising and endorsements, freedom of information, and the details of how disputes are resolved.Medium and you (formally the “Parties”) have decided that modifications of Medium’s standard Terms, available at https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f, are appropriate to allow for federal-compatible usage of Medium Services. The changes are designed to respect your legal status, your public mission, and other unique circumstances. And so the Terms are modified by this Amendment, as follows.A. Government entity: We want to clear up what “you” means within the Terms. For Government users, “you” means the Agency itself and will not apply to nor bind the individuals who use Medium Services on the Agency’s behalf. Instead, Medium will look solely to the Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Terms.B. Public purpose and usage: The Agency agrees to use Medium Services solely to fulfill the Agency’s public purpose. Medium acknowledges you may use Medium Services overseas and you may open and maintain more than one account. If Medium wants to promote your content with partner companies or services for broader broadcast, distribution, or publication, Medium will first contact you and make sure you understand and agree to Medium’s plans.C. Advertisements: Medium is allowed to serve what are commonly known as “house ads” on your pages in a non-intrusive manner. Medium does not currently display third-party advertisements, but this is subject to change. If you submit a written request to Medium to block the display of any commercial advertisements, solicitations, or links on the Agency’s board, Medium may so agree provided that it has decided to make such blocking technology generally available for all users. Agency’s sole remedy for Medium’s failure to implement such blocking technology shall be for Agency to terminate its Medium account.D. Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations, Governing law and Forum: The title of this section looks complicated yet the proposition is simple. Medium agrees that any provisions in the Terms related to legal subjects — such as indemnification, liability, damages, dispute forum, filing deadlines, defense of lawsuits, collection expenses, attorneys fees, and settlement — will apply to you only to the extent consistent with federal law. We expect everything to go smoothly, but Medium and you agree to proceed on the understanding that the Terms will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with applicable federal laws of the United States of America, and jurisdiction shall be in federal forums. To the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply.E. Limitation of liability: The parties disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. To the extent permitted under federal law, neither party will be liable to the other for indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages or penalties arising from or related to this agreement, and neither party’s liability for any cause of action arising from or relating to this agreement will exceed $50,000, except that we agree that nothing in the limitation of liability clause or elsewhere in the Terms in any way grants Medium a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law.F. Access and use: Medium understands that the Agency’s use of Medium Services may energize significant citizen engagement and otherwise become important to your public mission. Medium agrees, before terminating your service, refusing or removing your content, or closing your account, to first notify you of Medium’s intent and to give you a reasonable opportunity to cure any identified breach or failure, or otherwise resolve the matter.G. No Endorsement: Agency’s trademarks, trade names, domain names, designs, logos and seals (“Agency Marks”), Agency’s name, and the fact that you have a presence on Medium Services, shall not be used to imply an endorsement, sponsorship or preference by Agency or the Federal Government of Medium Services. However, the foregoing shall not prohibit Medium from using your name or Agency Marks to fulfill Medium’s obligations under this agreement. Medium may also include the Agency’s name and Agency Marks in partner lists and presentations solely for the purpose of promoting the availability of Agency’s content on the Medium platform and only so long as the Agency name and Agency Marks are not displayed in a more prominent fashion than those of any other third party name or Mark. If you ever have concerns about or objections to our use of any Agency Mark, you may contact us (using the “Contact Us” feature in our developer portal) and we will discuss your concerns in good faith. You always have the ability to terminate your Medium account and, following any such withdrawal, we will stop using the applicable Agency Marks.H. No business relationship created: You and Medium are independent entities and nothing in the Terms as modified by this Amendment creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employer/employee relationship.I. No cost agreement: Nothing in the Terms as modified by this Amendment obligates you to expend appropriations or incur financial obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the obligations arising from the Terms as modified by this Amendment are contingent upon the payment of fees by one party to the other.J. Paid Services and Agency responsibilities under paid usage plans: The Parties agree this Amendment applies to the Agency’s usage of both free and paid Services that Medium may offer. The Parties understand that fee-based products and services are categorically different than free products and services, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before the Agency decides to enter into a premium or enterprise subscription or any other fee-based service that Medium or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, the Agency agrees to determine if it has a need for those additional services for a fee, to consider the service’s value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere, to determine that Agency funds are available for payment, to properly use the Government Purchase Card if it is used as the payment method, to review any then-applicable Terms for conformance to federal procurement law and in all other respects follow federal acquisition rules when making the acquisition.K. Assignment: Neither party may assign its obligations under the Terms as modified by this Amendment to any third party without prior written consent of the other. However, if you are using Medium’s free services only, Medium or its subsidiaries may, without your consent, assign the Terms as modified by this Amendment to an affiliate, successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Medium’s assets.L. Termination rights: The Agency may close its account and terminate this agreement at any time. Medium may close the Agency’s account and terminate this agreement on 30 days written notice.M. Provision of data: In case of termination of service, within 30 days of such termination, upon request, Medium will provide you with all of your user-generated content that is publicly visible on the site. Data will be provided in a commonly used file or database format as Medium deems appropriate. Medium will not provide data if doing so would violate its privacy policy https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9.N. Security: Security is important to Medium; please refer to our Terms of Service for information about our security practices. Recognizing the changing nature of the Web, Medium will continuously work with users to ensure that its site and Services meet users’ requirements for the security of systems and data. Medium agrees to discuss implementing additional security controls as deemed necessary by the Agency to conform to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541 et seq.O. Federal Records: The Agency acknowledges that use of Medium Services may require management of Federal records. If Medium holds Federal records, the Agency and Medium must discuss the proper care of Federal records in accordance with applicable records management laws and regulations, including the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chs. 21, 29, 31, 33) and regulations of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA; at 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). Managing the records includes, but is not limited to, secure storage, retrievability, and proper disposition of all Federal records including transfer of permanently valuable records to NARA in a format and manner acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer. The Agency is the party responsible for ensuring that its use of Medium is compliant with federal records management laws and regulations.P. Precedence; Further Amendments: If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Terms, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules or policies on the Medium site or related to its Services, this Amendment shall prevail. Any further amendment must be agreed to in writing by both Parties. Current and future federal law, regulation and policy may affect the Agency’s use of Medium Services in ways not yet addressed by us. Among the topics the Agency may need to discuss with Medium, and which may lead to a mutual agreement to update this Amendment, are privacy and accessibility.Q. Posting of Amendment: This Amendment shall be posted with Medium’s online Terms either by incorporation of its text or via an integral link. Unlisted Public domain.

Now researching on Internet and open democracy.Feb 5, 2017走入山與海之間：閩東大刀會和兩岸走私閩東海濱是個山接海的地方，沿海是小小的灣澳錯落，漁船或遠或近地停泊。當我們沿著海邊走時，羅士傑老師總會興奮地說：「你看這地方，多適合躲人，就一副海盜窩的樣子！」這是一句激動的讚美，因為我們來此的目的是探訪民國時期的民間宗教武裝結社還有兩岸走私貿易。閩東沿岸的星星就是我們這次拜訪的地方。翻開閩東各地縣誌，從清末開始就充滿著各種倭寇進犯、禁烟令（禁止種植罌粟）、反洋教運動、取締花會捐（賭博）、緝鹽、民眾運動、走私。其中兩件事特別吸引了我們的注意。一是民國 32 年（1943 年）的大刀會暴動，聚集千餘人攻陷穆陽，國民黨政府緊急鎮壓，在民國 33 年處決首犯數餘人。大刀會是由地方仕紳組織成立的地方宗教團體「同善社」所延伸出來的武裝組織，目的是「防匪保家」。例如福安的同善社在民國 10 年創立於文昌祠樓上，民國 28 年反對當時縣長而暴動，有卸任知縣參與，被指控與「海匪」勾結，被指控以法師號召民眾、拜畸形兒做皇帝。後各地組織有與地方組織紅帶會結盟或對立，被國民黨肅清或接受國民黨資助對抗共產黨。這些所謂的「反動會道門」組織，一直在民間繼續傳佈，直到 1950-1960 年中國共產黨大力取締殲滅瑤池道、先天道、老母道、龍華道等「反動會道門」組織，才逐漸銷聲匿跡。二是綿延不斷的兩岸走私貿易。1950's - 1960's 兩岸仍不斷互相砲擊、飛偵測機、心戰喊話，甚至美軍和國民黨有空投昆蟲和細菌，縣誌上則記載陸續逮捕國民黨特務還有與海上保安隊對抗的紀錄。但有趣的是，在兩岸正式交流之前，1979 年三沙台灣漁民接待站就竣工了，1984 年後開始破獲走私，像是 1991 年霞浦破獲走私香菸三百多萬元，其他熱門走私品包括手錶、漁穫等。我們循著這兩條線索踏入閩東，展開歷史田野。身為歷史學家，老師有興趣的題目一直是「民間如何應對現代國家」，尤其以宗教作為地方組織的力量切入。如果單從檔案字面上看，我們很容易就對國家的敘事買單，但老師將民間視作有能動性的各種群體，有自己的邏輯，用自己的方法在跟所謂的「國家」互動。大概就是所謂的上有政策下有對策。這次文獻所引出的幾個有趣問題是，同善社、大刀會這樣的宗教紐帶，如何建立起地方武裝力量，他們又是如何與國民黨/中華民國、共產黨/中華人民共和國互動？同善社、大刀會這樣的宗教組織，也不若之前許多文獻中以廟宇為中心的討論地方的方法，而是以佛堂、法師為中心的組織。這樣的宗教組織，如何面對現代性的國家？尤其是當進入冷戰格局的兩岸對峙，對於地方脈絡來說，共產黨、國民黨、合法、非法的認知，還有國家對於他們來說又是什麼呢？宗教與地方三沙冬澳媽祖宮前老師上課總愛開玩笑說，在華南做宗教地方研究就是進村找廟、進廟找碑。這句話一半對。我們的確沿著舊時的海岸線，探訪了幾間天后宮、文武靈王廟，往外眺望曾經是海的地方。也在前岐的天后宮撒麵粉抄錄了奉憲示禁碑，從前岐這個明礬出口的河口，一路追到靠近溫州的明礬主要產地礬山鎮。（這是另外一個有意思的明礬貿易與「階級革命」的故事了，老師說應該可以寫一篇碩論了）但就像在字裡行間看出微言大義，我們在找官方敘事之外的民間故事還有廟宇之外的地方宗教運作方式。根據當時的調查文獻上，所謂的「反動會道門」有各式各樣職業，許多是城市小資產階級，不乏外地人，設壇於民宅中，由法師定時帶領會眾誦經行法事。老師解釋說宗教不只是逢年過節祭拜而已，需要形成團體互相支持。但在我看來這樣的組織是平行於媽祖信仰的、文武靈王、華光大帝的一種信仰方式，不然直接以媽祖做為號召即可，何必再搞出一個老母娘/瑤池金母在拜呢？地方上的宗教組織，可能是有好幾個宗教團體相互拮抗，像是如今的一貫道與媽祖信仰平行吸納群眾信仰。反動會道門在 1960’s 後基本上銷聲匿跡，這種祕密宗教組織也難以短時間與當地人聊天取得資訊。不過我們在三沙找到天地壇，裡面祭拜當年的壇主與不知名神明。也在天后宮裡發現兼拜奶娘。或是記述毛一、毛二法師行至羅源一帶弘法治病。在連江一帶則沿路多佛堂，有師父定時帶領誦經念課。其中一個佛堂裡的顧堂大嬸跟我們表示，這間佛堂本在偏僻山中，由「菜友」集資買下現在這塊地，興建佛堂，觀看廟牆上的捐獻紀錄多見女性，呼應文獻上鄉村中老年女性藉由宗教活動脫離家庭責任。拜觀音需脫鞋，旁邊則是一個食堂，有桌椅和廚房供集會之用。佛堂也更進一步與安養系統整合，我們進到一個直接名為「安養念佛堂」的佛堂，裡面有三十多位年長居士居住，兩三位師父，富麗堂皇。不過這樣的宗教組織聯繫，有沒有在兩岸之間牽起貿易網絡呢？這點還不是很清楚。或是宗教武裝組織如何與現代化互動？在文獻看起來，大刀會這批人先是被國民黨認為是迷信的地方組織需要清肅，後抗日又有合作，又與共產黨不合，國民黨在 1949 年撤退後還提供機關槍供其對抗共產黨。宗教在地方的形式會經過許多轉化與整合，例如這次拜訪的許多廟宇是在西元兩千年後才修建，可視為配合地方復興政策，或是那時鄉村真的開始富起來了，或是配合統戰政策，例如一間天后宮牆上貼著胡錦濤 2006 年 1 月時的談話：「媽祖信仰深深的紮根在台灣民眾的精神生活中，我們要運用好這一豐富資源，在促進兩岸交流中更好地發揮作用。」許多廟宇也與地方文化禮堂結合，一樓是挑高的禮堂活動空間，二樓則是廟。最絕的可能是我們走訪的一間鄭氏宗祠，上面掛了三個匾額：文化禮堂、鄭成功紀念館、鄭氏宗祠。看起來顯然是為了拿補助，一口氣讓整個場館多功能，一樓有球桌和很大的鄭成功塑像，二樓則是宗祠。這可視為地方對於政策的一種應對，以政策要求的外殼包裝地方需求。從大陸面對海洋：敵人還是朋友？「祖國大陸距離馬祖最近的地方」，大大的標語掛在連江縣黃岐鎮的入口。的確很近，1950 年馬祖駐軍砲擊黃岐鎮，三十多座民房被毀。如今在黃岐小三通的客運碼頭，寫著「連江縣同胞熱烈歡迎台灣同胞拜訪祖國大陸」，一天各兩班船班往返馬祖，航程不到三十分鐘。港口旁是頂著斗笠在補網的漁民，直接把網鋪開在馬路上，有羊在旁邊悠閒的晃蕩，不遠處則是船員介紹所。這裡講的方言屬福州系統，但在其他許多靠海的小漁村裡，雖靠近福州，我們竟可以以閩南語通行。老師一個想像是閩南語人群是海上的人，因此靠海的港口可能會有閩南語。閩東可能是最後一個蜑民上岸的地方。水上仍有人家我們跑了五天的沿海漁村，其實面貌各異。除了傳統的小漁村，有的地方建造海堤把河口內海做為農地，有的地方填海造建鋼鐵廠、核電廠或是一座每棟建築都二十層樓高且長的一模一樣的新城，也有些地方開一般的工廠，村裡的大街在辦年貨擠的水泄不通。也有些地方布滿的解放軍的軍事基地，商業化大概就無緣了。這也不奇怪，閩東歷來就有許多海防的衛所，我們拜訪了定海古城和浦城。衛所是明代的軍事制度，從外地派駐軍隊，駐紮在高牆圍起的城裡，佔據海防要地，依山傍海，山後有屯田。不過如今駐紮於此的解放軍，許多都是劃在南京軍區下的南方人，很多是福建人。我們跟身著藍色迷彩服的解放軍一同搭船前往三都澳，光緒二十三年正式開放作為對外通商口岸，設置海關。街上一片蕭索，我們氣喘吁吁爬上了一座山坡，俯瞰整個三都澳的港灣，山頭上座落著教堂還有貌似海關/洋行的歐式建築。我們跟一個在解放軍部隊待了十二年的大哥聊天，他說：「我恨死陳水扁了。我那時請假回家結婚，結果結婚前一天接到士官長的電話要我回部隊『戰備』，就只因為陳水扁要參選，還是長官給我方便，給我說成是去遼寧，趕回部隊要三天，我才結到婚的。但之後每次跟老婆吵架，她就會說：『我從結婚那天就看你很不順眼了！』」我啃著繼光餅（對，就是傳說戚繼光打倭寇時做的餅），聽老師跟大哥聊抓逃兵聊得不亦樂乎，原來兩岸抓逃兵的 SOP 和規定是一樣的啊！大哥說兩岸和平該有多好，大家都是可以交朋友嘛。說到走私，當地人說船體通體漆黑，沒有船舷，開得飛快，海防艦艇追不上。其中買賣油是筆好生意，台灣漁民會把油加滿開到公海上，大陸這頭的漁民再去取油，兩方心照不宣。沿途也有看到佔地甚廣的台灣漁民招待所。這些招待所建在兩岸正式通航之前。這些「漁民」在此之前可能被視作「特務」，從請吃子彈到請喝茶互相作為心戰宣傳管道。其實走私沒我們想像的那麼遠。從廈門小三通回台灣時，當地旅行社的櫃檯一直要我們「帶包香菇」，一個人給你一百元人民幣。當時直接拒絕了，很怕不是真的香菇，但上網查了之後發現好像是真的香菇，只是台灣跟中國的香菇價差太大了。雜記文章最後還是沒回答文章一開始針對宗教與走私所提出的大問題，只是用這樣的角度看民間社會與現代國家的互動會很有趣，就請大家期待老師的論文吧！這趟走下來，除了推論歷史，我不斷提醒自己的是要去看見那些互聯網之外的地方，尤其我們走在那些百度地圖上沒有的小路上時。羅士傑老師一向關注人是怎麼活著的，我則在思考當我們說著公民科技的時候，這樣的科技對於農村的人生活影響能有多少，有科技就能翻轉政治權力嗎？還是需整合舊有的民間凝聚力量？下一代的農村年輕人還會依附於宗教上嗎？他們信仰的會是什麼？老師回台灣的路上一直在講台灣人年輕人 — 尤其是要台獨的人 — 對中國不夠瞭解，不理解中國年輕人的話題也不瞭解農村。福建鄉下地方過年熱鬧的緊，鎮上那條大街整排的樹都掛上了紅燈籠，採買年貨的人穿梭在狂按喇吧的車陣中，幾個小孩蹦跳而過，老師轉身問我：「你覺得十年後這些小孩會在做什麼？」附錄感謝臺大歷史系羅士傑教授，以及台大歷史所學姐鄭凌霄，學姐正好是福州羅源人，一路上張羅田野行程還有方言翻譯。出田野有在地人真的很重要啊！福安縣誌 p697福安縣誌 p698福安縣誌 p733,734回台灣的路上，跟老師聊大學教育，老師說：「大學是年輕人最有餘裕思考人文問題的人，我們卻要急著將他們往職場推。」對我而言是以正向心態擁抱自己的餘裕，且越發覺得自己念的書太少，要多讀書。Some rights reserved 田野歷史閩東大刀會走私One clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Yun-Chen Chien（簡韻真）Nobody in @g0v.tw, PM in sense.tw to build online deliberation tools.

      "Vaibhav KhulbeAndroid App Developer | I write forum posts on The Verge | ACM MemberMay 6, 2017How fast can a camera get?When light practically stood still…Answer this question yourself. What’s the highest rated camera in terms of its frame capturing speed? You will basically search for the term high-speed camera. Then you will see a list of cameras that shows you frame capture with increment of 50 frames in each step. 100 fps, 150 fps, 200 fps, or even 250 fps. Now, hold a plate and observe the following sentence:The speed needed to render your plate invisible to the camera is 119 million miles per hour.The whole thing has already been explained here in Phys.org’s 2014 blog. But why I’m writing all this?1,000,000,000,000 frames please!The camera that can capture 1 trillion frames a second - fast enough for slow-motion video of light…The first stunning images of moving bullets appeared around 50 years ago - now a team of snap happy scientists have…www.dailymail.co.ukThe above headline from Daily Mail says 1 trillion frames, yes a trillion which is quite suitable to capture the speed of the fastest thing that matters. You guessed it right, the light! The brain behind this mind-blowing innovation were scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For this to happen, the team used a camera that collected the light beams at a rate of roughly one trillion frames per second. Ramesh Raskar, the Associate Professor of the MIT Media Lab said:We have built a virtual slow motion camera where were can see photons, or light particles, moving through space.Did you heard that? We were able to see the goddamn photons! The 500 nanometer stuff! Well, the actual science (as we know it) behind Sir Ramesh’s camera was a single large lens working alongside an array of 500 sensors. Plus, they replaced the regular camera flash with a titanium sapphire laser so that the pulse of the wave generated lasts less than one trillionth of a second.Then, one of the system developer said:There’s nothing in the universe that looks fast to this camera.And there you go. A researcher from some other part of the globe noted this and planned to go even further. Well, you never know what’s going inside a human brain!Let it be 5 trillionPic credit: Lund UniversityEarlier if a tech blogger or a news reporter would come across a camera with a frame capture rate of 1000 fps then he/she would be like “Forget high-speed cameras capturing 100 images per second, now we have a camera with 1K fps!”. Enough. We are in 2017 and we need something which really changes the perspective.Seems like researchers at Sweden’s Lund Univeristy heard you right! They made a super-duper fast camera with a whooping five trillion frames per second! This very new tech is called FRAME which is short for Frequency Recognition Algorithm for Multiple Exposures. Cool. The idea is to capture several coded images into a single picture.Credit to Elias Kristensson and Andreas Ehn, they filmed how light travels a distance equivalent to the thickness of a paper. And that’s so amazing that I’ve started thinking more about science than about technology. What’s even more interesting is this that in reality it takes a picosecond but on the film that exact process has been slowed down to a trillionth of a time. Nice move.If such a camera will sell sometime in near future then other researchers who literally want to gain better insight into the diverse and unseen events of nature will surely step ahead in buying this marvel. Counter to the MIT’s system developer, Elias Kristensson said:This does not apply to all processes in nature, but quite a few, for example, explosions, plasma flashes, turbulent combustion, brain activity in animals and chemical reactions. We are now able to film such extremely short processes.Talking about its presence in the market, you will be delighted to know that the world’s fastest film camera has backed a German company which has already developed a prototype of the technology and what that means? Give them 2+ years and there you’ll have it.

Are you?That’s perfectly okay. Before I actually begin to write about what’s my brain problem, I want you to answer the following questions:When was the last time you played a mobile game that caught your attention by just looking at its logo?When was the last time you messaged your dearest buddy and he/she replied you with utmost care and importance?When was the last time a mobile game made you really happy?When was the last time when you started a chat in WhatsApp and it had multiple endings?What if life gave you another chance to learn to love again?I’m pretty sure that you got my point of discussion. Did you? Let’s be clear now.Last year, an indie game studio was born in the Philippines. It was named Polychroma. Like every other company they had a motto too. Making games that deliver unique experiences for various game players around the globe. Much to my excitement, the studio’s founder is a 16 year old lead programmer. And this studio’s first and highly successful game is called Seen. Strange?What is so special about it?Seen is currently available only for the Android platform. But that doesn’t mean that users are not playing it everyday. It’s not just another write and go game. It’s much more. It has already created a new platform for games. It changed the idea of how we play a game and yes, interact with it.To begin with, you play (by default) by the name of Mark Blythe. The game assumes that you are a student who just fell in love with the new fellow student, Nicole Tyler. Now it is up to you how will you catch her heart. I know some readers will think what if I’m a girl? Will I get to know about a boy and will I be able to play a game not as Mark Blythe? The answer (as you’ve probably guessed it) is YES. There are both virtually an literally no limitations on how you will play this game. You can add or edit the default name to your own like.By the above chat samples and the embedded video you may now have guessed what type of game it is. It is categorized as a simulation game in the Google Play Store and it really simulates your senses when you will play it. See the following screenshot:Image credit: Google Play StoreThe interface is quite familiar and comparable to the Facebook Messenger. Let us not dig into that matter for now. You are now playing a simple chat-based game. The games’s software may or may not start a conversation with you. Next, you tap the space for your reply to that but, wait. There is no keyboard here! Well, this might seem quite awkward at first but when you apply those little grey cells (Ah, Poirot!) you will get to know that there is indeed no need for that! You are either choosing a reply from a list of three options, or you are just tapping here and there on the invisible keyboard. In the above screenshot you can see Jenny Cumberdale, your love interest’s friend, she wants you to answer some of her doubts regarding his crazy homework. Here, you are more like “Why should I help her?” “I must concentrate on my ongoing work now.” “Who is she?” So you make excuses as stated in the picture above. Well, everything does not end here. You can reply to Jenny more like a dear friend to her like “Okay, tell me what is it?” “Sure Jenny!” or even go to an extent to propose her! I know you love Nicole. Still, you are now crazy for Jenny because of her past experiences with you. Then you may end up being an enemy of Nicole. See, anything can happen here. The ending of this game may or may not be a good one. This is the type of game that we wanted for years! Didn’t we?A little bit moreNow, what’s more good in this game? Everyone loves bonus content. Yes, Polychroma heard you quick. Here are some of the stuff which you will love:There’s always a different outcome of every story you play.You be the author!

      "Kate Reed Pettyi like you. pettykate.comApr 2, 2017Now That’s ComedyLearn to write running jokes from Ali Smith’s “How to Be Both,” a master class in delight.Photo: Library of Congress, 2012 / FlickrAbout two weeks ago, I started keeping a list of every time I laughed out loud.I got the idea while reading this Leah Finnegan piece about music criticism. I was on a scary plane ride at the time; Finnegan’s writing made me laugh so hard I was distracted from the turbulence, from my looming work deadlines, and even from the child watching cartoons without headphones in the seat next to me. The line that made me laugh out loud was:My review: It’s pretty good!I can’t give you any tips on why that line is funny or how it works, because it earns its power from the preceding 1,300 words.And when I think about it, that is true of everything on my laugh-out-loud list. Everything that made me laugh in recent weeks is weird out of context, and not that funny:my niece, when asked where mysterious puddle of sugar on floor came from: ‘i’ve been wondering about that, too.’your [Kate’s] to-do list is like you’re banging nails in a board. ‘i set up 6 nails for myself and i have to bang them all in, in every morning, so that everything-can-be-in-order-thank-you-very-much.’saw a corgi with real short legsThese were funny to me because I was tired, because I’d spent an hour with my nieces playing games and making a mess and none of us wanted to clean it up, because my partner pointed out something true about me that I hadn’t realized in six months of obsessive to-do-listing, because my mind was wandering on the walk home from the coffee shop and a funny fat dog with the shortest legs I’d ever seen slipped my stream of consciousness like a banana peel.photo: anko.gaku_ula / FlickrIn other words, they were funny because of everything that came before them.In other words, humor needs context.That laugh-out-loud list was a nice IV drip of joy for a couple weeks. But then I had to stop. Because I read Ali Smith’s book, How to Be Both, and the novel is so delightful and surprising and funny that I ran out of paper.The humor in the book surprised me, because many reviewers categorize How to Be Both as a serious book. It is hard work. It is complicated, cerebral, full of “structural trickery.” For example, The New York Times’ book critic Janet Maslin accuses Smith of being “quite distant” about her intentions, although she begrudgingly admits the book “has a lot more allure than its overall rigor suggests.” As if rigor were not alluring! (Rigor? Blech, no thanks! I prefer writers to phone it in.)While Maslin’s review is deeply respectful and positive, she recommends the book the way you’d recommend a non-fad diet — sorry, there’s no juice or coconut oil involved, it’s literally just watching what you eat and exercising, for the rest of your life — when in fact this book is a feast.It’s true that How to Be Both defies some conventions that allow readers to quickly calibrate our expectations. But understanding something slowly is not the same as hard work; the experience of learning the “truth” about the characters through steady revelation is part of this book’s delight.Part One is a close third-person narrative about George, a bereaved teenage girl in the modern UK. The other Part One — both parts are labeled “one” — is the first-person narrative of Francescho, a 15th century Italian painter. Chronology in both sections flips between past and present as seamlessly as, say, that complex and nonlinear (and yet somehow alluring!) HBO show Big Little Lies. Or, say, its celebrated (and yet so stupid) ancestor True Detective. And time is indeed a flat circle for How to Be Both: In some editions, George’s narrative is printed first and Francescho’s second, while in others its the other way round.But shoot. I just spent a lot of time describing the structure of the book after decrying the amount of time that other reviewers spend describing the structure of the book. For that I am deeply sorry.What I really want to write about is the fact that this book is hilarious — and why.How to Be Both is consistently funny, but it suddenly got a lot funnier in the second half. At first, I thought this was because the second half is funnier. Now, I’ve decided it’s because the second half comes second.If I’d read the alternative edition of this book, I would still think the second half was funnier, even though it was the opposite half. This is because no matter what order you read it, the second half will always have more context. The perspective shift gives Smith an excuse to retell some of the same story, to go back and harvest all of the seeds she planted in the first half. She has a wealth of details and patterns to recall and reframe, giving readers moments of joyful recognition (oh I remember that character! I remember this scene!).This kind of recognition is one of three ingredients in a joke; the other two are surprise and incongruity. We laugh when we are surprised by recognizing something incongruous. While this works at the level of the entire novel, we can see a small example of it within a couple dozen pages of Francescho’s Part One.Francescho is a ghost who follows and watches George (and mistakes him for a boy). With a father who was an professional mason, Francescho has an eye for the integrity of a brick wall:Just saying, even though these houses we’re outside are grand, well appointed and many-storeyed, the boy is on a small low wall whose bricks are crying out for love : the knowing of this is the knowledge of my father turning over in his grave in his natural impatience and knocking on the lid of the box I put him in to have someone let him up and out of the ground to remake such a wall : cause if all the dead were given this chance, with their hindsight and experience this world or purgatorium would I think be better made.This is a lovely paragraph, insightful, maybe not particularly funny, but still great. Then six pages later, while bragging, Francescho can’t help returning to the subject of walls:In this way my father made sure of an education and an apprenticeship for me, though it maddened my brothers to be always what they considered his workshop serfs, like infidel workers compared to me they thought, carrying and working the stones and bricks that I sat and drew and calculated with, seeing to the shaping of the windows I then used as frames for seeing or sat below using the light of for reading a mathematical book or a treatise on pigments, protecting my hands.I’m good at walls too cause I also learned from looking how to handle stone and brick and how to build a wall to last a lot longer than this one the boy is sitting on now.This second mention of the wall is funny, because we experience surprise (Why did the subject shift from mastery of painting to building walls?) as well as incongruity (wall building is not a Serious Art like painting) as well as recognition (“Oh, right,” we remember, “Francescho is egotistic and really serious about walls.”)The joke gets really funny when it comes back a third time, thirteen pages later:This boy is a girl.I knew it.I know it cause we sat on that poor specimen of wall (which will not last) until a much older woman, bent by the years, came out of the dwelling behind us making a great furor …This little tossed away joke — the “wall (which will not last)” — is surprising and incongruous, but we recognize it. Once again, Francescho is egotistic and really serious about walls enough to bring the subject up again, even here, in the middle of a much-more-important revelation about George’s gender.Francescho’s voice and worldview is not familiar, but it is still hilarious, and absorbing. For example: While reading the book, and then through most of the process of writing this essay, I forgot how controversial the phrase “build a wall” is today. That sweet forgetfulness should recommend this book as much as anything else.This book is as cerebral, as anti-chronological, and as interrogative of narrative as True Detective (but without that show’s bullshit). It is also a welcoming book, a delightful read, and an instructive lesson in weaving the same joke multiple times through a story, getting funnier each time.Okay, actually, the only real rule about humor is that it’s never funny to explain a joke, which I just did. Again, I’m deeply sorry. But if you’re gonna build a wall (that will last), you gotta know how a brick works.And if you want your writing to make an impact, humor is an effective tool. It’s a way of inviting your audience to enjoy the reading experience, and getting them to agree with you. Even if you’re writing a grant report or a technical research paper, a little (appropriate) humor will grease the wheels.Professional humor does have to be appropriate — which is why the kind of running joke that Smith demonstrates above is especially useful for professional writing.Running jokes don’t rely on shocking the audience with controversial or off-color topics or recognizable experiences or shared ideas about how the world works. They rely entirely on their own structure. They draw their power entirely from the context of what you’ve written before. It’s the one kind of humor for which you can entirely control the context. For writers working for social change, that’s the kind of wall that’s gonna last.This is Reading to Write, a series of writing tips collected from books I recommend.

E non è la storia in sé ad interessare, ma il personaggio: «Gola Profonda». Per la soluzione del mistero, per lo svelamento del segreto, si dovrà aspettare ben trentatré anni, cioè il 2005, quando sul numero di Luglio della rivista patinata Vanity Fair finalmente quell’uomo ci mette la faccia.«Gola Profonda» è lui.Il segreto meglio tenuto d’America è svelato.Bob e Carl hanno fatto un lavoro dannatamente buono, scoperchiando lo scandalo con le sole armi che un buon giornalista d’inchiesta può avere, con il supporto di una grande testata come il Washington Post e, ovviamente, con l’aiuto di una fonte bene informata sui fatti: un whistleblower diremmo oggi. Lo fanno a dispetto delle intimidazioni e dei depistaggi, degli inquinamenti e degli ostacoli.Lo fanno a dispetto del Presidente degli Stati Uniti d’America.Bob e Carl lo fanno così bene da meritare un premio Pulitzer, il riconoscimento più prestigioso per un giornalista. Ma Bob e Carl lo fanno anche meglio di così perché per trentatré anni nessuno ha mai potuto scoprire chi fosse la fonte. Tutti la chiamano la «Gola Profonda» del caso «Watergate», perché per quelle casualità che solo il destino sa divertirsi a fornire, questa «Gola Profonda» entra in scena contemporaneamente a quell’altra «Gola Profonda» che conquista l’America per ben altre doti, e ne prende il nome.Il mito di un film in cui nulla è nascosto si trasforma nel personaggio mitico di cui non si può conoscere l’identità.Bob Woodward e Carl Bernstein sono titolati come i più grandi giornalisti d’America per quello che hanno scritto, ma anche per quello che non hanno mai svelato: chi è «Gola Profonda».Mark Felt su Vanity FairW. Mark Felt, questo il nome di «Gola Profonda» dello scandalo «Watergate», si ritira dal suo incarico di Vice-Direttore del Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) giusto un anno e quattro giorni dopo l’inizio dello scandalo e dopo trentuno anni di servizio. La sua carriera inizia durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale con sedici mesi di addestramento all’Accademia FBI di Quantico e continua con frequenti spostamenti in giro per gli Stati Uniti e il mondo. Diventa nel 1971 il più fidato collaboratore del mitico e inamovibile funzionario-semidio ed eroe nazionale Edgar J. Hoover che per oltre cinquant’anni rimase a capo di una FBI sempre più potente. Hoover muore per un attacco cardiaco esattamente 45 giorni prima dell’inizio dello scandalo Watergate. Non è un caso.I fascicoli segretissimi dell’ufficio di Hoover passano nelle mani di Felt che a quel tempo è il numero 3 dell’FBI: è assistente personale del numero 2, Clyde Tolson che, si vocifera, ha con Edgar J. una relazione ben oltre quella professionale tanto che alla morte ne eredita gli effetti personali e anche l’appartamento di proprietà. L’incarico di direttore del Bureau però passa a L. Patrick Gray, uno degli uomini tuttofare della presidenza Nixon. Gray però miseramente dura in carica meno di un anno: crolla quando si scopre che ha incendiato nel camino di casa documenti relativi allo scandalo.W. Mark FeltCome direttore dell’agenzia, Gray è comunque una frana, non fa che andare in giro tra una sede locale e l’altra, senza curarsi delle attività, al punto che è soprannominato “Three-Day Gray” (Gray 3 giorni), perché questo è il tempo medio che permane da qualche parte. D’altro canto, il suo è un incarico eminentemente politico con cui l’amministrazione Nixon vuole riportare sotto il diretto controllo del Presidente il Bureau, che sotto la guida di Hoover è sempre stata una vera agenzia indipendente. A Nixon serve uno yes-man che non faccia troppi guai. E Gray li fa.Quando Gray tracolla sotto il peso delle inchieste giornalistiche, Nixon ha ancora l’opportunità di nominare Felt che è il più alto in grado e il più titolato. Nixon ha tutte le prove della cospirazione e ha anche ragionevoli dubbi circa il fatto che possa essere direttamente lui l’informatore di Woodward e Bernstein. Ovviamente Felt non diventa direttore e la «vecchia guardia» dell’FBI è tagliata fuori.Felt sceglie il pensionamento non immaginando quello che l’attende.Nixon resiste un altro anno fino a quando viene divulgato un nastro in cui si sente distintamente mentre ordina di ostacolare le indagini sullo scandalo facendo trasmettere un falso comunicato da parte della CIA rivolto all’FBI sulla necessità di copertura delle prove per motivi di sicurezza nazionali. Questa è la pistola fumante e fa definitivamente precipitare Nixon. È il 9 agosto 1974 e sarà il primo presidente nella storia degli Stati Uniti a dimettersi dalla carica per evitare il processo di impeachment. Si dimette senza aspettare il processo per mantenere il potere nelle mani dei repubblicani. La presidenza passa al suo vice, l’appena nominato, massone e inconsistente, Gerald Ford che peraltro ha preso il posto di Spiro Agnew dimessosi anche lui da qualche mese sotto l’accusa di frode fiscale. Bella gente.Dai processi scaturiti dallo scandalo Watergate saranno tutti condannati per crimini tra i più gravi: cospirazione, falsa testimonianza, spergiuro, attività illegali, inquinamento delle indagini. Per Nixon stesso le accuse saranno quelle di abuso di potere e ostacolo al Congresso degli Stati Uniti.Né la storia di Felt, né quella di «Gola Profonda» finiscono qui, prima di ricongiungersi nella stessa persona con l’intervista del 31 maggio 2005.A Felt è riservato il trattamento comune che spetta ai whistleblower: le ritorsioni del datore di lavoro. Anche a quel livello, anche in quei casi. Il nuovo Presidente Gerald Ford si affretta ad accordare subito la grazia a Nixon per gli eventuali crimini commessi nell’esercizio delle sue funzioni. Grazia Presidenziale. L’amministrazione repubblicana va avanti altri tre anni fino alla rovinosa sconfitta elettorale contro Jimmy Carter e si distingue per una virulenta campagna contro gli «abusi» delle agenzie, come CIA e FBI, che Carter dovrà completare senza cedimenti.L’opinione pubblica negli Stati Uniti ha sempre coltivato una feroce avversione per il «potere centrale» è frastornata da questa battaglia tra poteri dello stato. La stampa ha bisogno di mantenere le vendite che lo scandalo Watergate gli ha garantito. Il governo, azzoppato dallo scandalo tenta di rifarsi sui burocrati che non l’hanno sostenuto.Sebbene fin dal 1778 gli Stati Uniti abbiano una legge scritta per tutelare i whistleblower, Felt, che non ammetterà mai di essere l’informatore, non può godere di queste tutele.Tutto inizia già nel ’71 quando un gruppo di attivisti fa irruzione nella sede locale dell’FBI in Pennsylvania e ruba le prove concrete sulle attività illegali del Bureau. Tutto finisce alla stampa che ne monta un caso anche se è ben noto che l’FBI e i servizi segreti abbiano sempre fatte attività illegali senza grossi scrupoli.Stealing J. Edgar Hoover's SecretsThe most important heist you've never heard of:www.retroreport.orgA quel punto però il Senato apre una commissione parlamentare (la Church Commission) che porta alla sbarra vari funzionari del Bureau e dei servizi segreti. Vengono scandagliate sopratutto le attività del CO.INTEL.PRO, il programma di contro-intelligence del Bureau, attivo fin dal ’56 e che per un breve periodo era stato sotto la guida di Felt. Molte azioni degli agenti sono segrete e non raramente illegali per contrastare le attività considerate sovversive, ivi includendo i movimenti pacifisti contro la guerra in Vietnam come i cattolici del Camden 28, i gruppi radicali marxisti come i Weatherman (WUO), i gruppi di rivendicazione razziali, le arci-note Pantere Nere e Martin Luther King, molte organizzazioni femministe e i movimenti anti-colonialisti, insomma tutto quello che variamente era incluso nell’etichetta molto ampia di «Nuova Sinistra» americana.Le operazioni del CO.INTEL.PRO sono spesso condotte in spregio delle leggi, senza il necessario supporto degli ordini giudiziari e prive di qualsiasi garanzia costituzionale. Nonostante questo è dato per scontato che questo sia un privilegio dovuto ai «servizi segreti».Felt, sotto accusa come capo delle operazioni di contro-intelligenza nel caso del WUO, in cui questi terroristi hanno messo bombe presso la Casa Bianca, il Pentagono e il Dipartimento di Stato, si assume ogni responsabilità delle azioni illegali, ed evita l’incriminazione dei suoi agenti che per lo più hanno commesso furti su commissione (i cosiddetti “black bag jobs”) per ottenere le prove necessarie a smantellare l’organizzazione criminale.Felt propone al governo un patteggiamento basato su una dichiarazione di colpevolezza per lo svolgimento di ricerche senza mandato, un reato minore che si risolverebbe con poco più di una censura, ma tra l’incredulità sua e degli altri agenti FBI, il governo, rompendo una tradizione ben radicata, rifiuta l’offerta e il funzionario viene condannato per la violazione dei diritti costituzionali dei cittadini, una condanna durissima. Durante il processo testimonia in sostegno di Felt (e addirittura contribuisce alle sue spese legali) persino l’ex-presidente Nixon, che era un falco del Partito Repubblicano, ma certamente non un’aquila.Le attività ordinate da Felt, secondo Nixon e moltissimi degli altri testimoni di alto livello intervenuti, sono sempre state comuni per l’FBI fin dalla presidenza Roosevelt e non sono mai state considerate illegali.Alla fine Felt sarà condannato a 10 anni di prigione. È il capro espiatorio che Jimmy Carter offre in pasto all’opinione pubblica, facendo un unico falò degli abusi della precedente amministrazione con il comportamento opaco delle agenzie di sicurezza sfuggite al controllo politico. La stampa esulta. È il 6 Novembre 1980, Felt prepara il suo appello.Mark Felt e Ronald ReaganDopo neppure tre mesi Ronald Reagan diventa il nuovo Presidente degli Stati Uniti ed è pronto a concedergli la grazia quando viene colpito al polmone da un proiettile di un balordo che addurrà come motivazione quella di voler far colpo sull’attrice Jodie Foster. È ancora oggi richiuso in un manicomio criminale. La grazia a Felt sarà firmata il 15 Aprile, appena tre giorni dopo il rientro di Reagan nel suo ufficio dopo una difficilissima operazione in cui ha seriamente rischiato la morte. Il malcontento per la grazia viene presto oscurato dal muscolare successo di Reagan che licenzia su due piedi 11.345 controllori di volo in sciopero illegale. L’opinione pubblica esulta, è l’inizio della Reaganomics.Felt comunque vince anche il processo d’appello.W. Mark Felt aveva già negato di essere la «Gola Profonda» dello scandalo «Watergate» ad una domanda diretta di Gray nel bel mezzo degli avvenimenti e quanto nel ’79 pubblica le sue memorie lo fa in modo ancora più netto tanto che «Library Journal» nella recensione del libro dirà che:«essendo stato indicato come la ‘Gola Profonda’ del Watergate, in questo libro di memorie interessante ma poco sensazionale, egli chiarisce una volta per tutte che questo onore, se di onore si tratta, va ricercato altrove».È giunto il momento per Felt di ritirarsi a vita privata in California. Un tranquillo pensionamento turbato solo da un unico episodio, nel 1999 a seguito del 25° anniversario delle dimissioni di Nixon, tra i tanti giornalisti che chiedono la sua opinione, uno solo va a trovarlo di persona e quella visita, sotto gli occhi divertiti e stupiti della figlia, si tramuta in una vera e propria celebrazione. Il giornalista in questione è Bob Woodward.Mentre Felt ha il suo bel da fare per uscire indenne dalla girandola giudiziaria, il resto del mondo prova a scoprire chi è «Gola Profonda».Grazie per aver letto questa storia!

Se ti è piaciuta la storia puoi seguirmi anche sulla mia pagina Facebook.Felt è fortemente indiziato, è ovvio, ma non è che uno solo dei quindici nomi nella lista che ancora nel 1990 il ben introdotto magazine The Washingtonian stila per riassumere il caso. In realtà già nel 1974 l’editor del Washingtonian, Jack Limpert, ha fornito evidenze quasi inoppugnabili che la talpa sia Felt, ma il Wall Street Journal chiude la questione con un editoriale lapidario: «Se bevi scotch, fumi e leggi, allora forse sei tu Gola Profonda», e la cortina fumogena su Felt inizia a sollevarsi. Nel ’75 è la volta dello scrittore e giornalista Higgins di ricordare che «Mike Felt conosce i giornalisti più di quanto questi ne sappiano e ci sono alcuni che pensano che egli abbia uno pseudonimo al Washington Post preso in prestito da un film porno». Nel 1976, Felt testimonia dinanzi al gran giurì e ammette il suo ruolo nel caso Watergate al Procuratore Generale per i Diritti Civili J. Stanley Pottinger, ma la testimonianza viene coperta da segreto di Stato e quindi non trapela in giro. Nel ’92 anche un collaboratore di Woodward stesso sostiene che le informazioni alla redazione provenivano da un altissimo funzionari nell’FBI, ma non conferma che si tratti proprio di Felt. Nel 2000 il consigliere legale alla Casa Bianca di Nixon sostiene nel suo libro che Gola Profonda sia Felt, ma poi dubita perché così non si spiega come talune informazioni alla stampa arrivino anche direttamente dall’interno della Casa Bianca (la verità è che gli agenti FBI non avevano problemi ad ottenere informazioni dall’amministrazione Nixon che era un colabrodo in quanto a segreti).Bob Woodward e Carl Bernstein interpretati da Robert Redford e Dustin Hoffman nel film «Tutti gli uomini del presidente» di Alan J. Pakula sullo scandalo Watergate.La storia finisce quanto a Febbraio del 2005 qualcuno divulga che «Gola Profonda» stia lì lì per tirare le cuoia visto che Bob Woodward ha già scritto un coccodrillo commemorativo (uno di quegli articoli che i giornali scrivono con un po’ di anticipo sulla morte di persone famose, in modo da poterli inserire se necessario anche all’ultimo momento nell’impaginazione). Ironicamente si diffonde la voce che Gola Profonda sia William H. Rehnquist che era proprio al Dipartimento di Giustizia sotto Nixon e che nel 2005 sta combattendo un cancro brutale che lo porterà via effettivamente dopo qualche mese.È probabilmente il fatto di sapere della presenza del coccodrillo di Woodward che spinge Felt a svelare, il 31 maggio di quell’anno, tramite l’intervista esclusiva a Vanity Fair di essere «Gola Profonda». Il Washington Post conferma la storia e Woodward racconta come Felt era diventato «Gola Profonda» ma lascia a Patricia Sullivan il compito di riscrivere il coccodrillo di Felt che tornerà utile solo qualche anno dopo, il 18 dicembre 2008, quando, alla veneranda età di 95 anni, Mike Felt muore nel sonno.Non sapremo mai le vere motivazioni che portarono Felt a spifferare tutto. Le interpretazioni sono diametralmente opposte. C’è chi considera Felt un vero e proprio eroe nazionale e chi lo considera uno spergiuro e un traditore, chi piuttosto un arrivista frustrato per essere stato scavalcato alla guida del Bureau. Allo stesso modo il Washington Post e i due, allora giovani, giornalisti sono osannati come baluardi della moralità pubblica della politica mentre altri li considerano invece semplici pedine nelle mani di una FBI interessata a liberarsi di un Presidente scomodo.Quale che sia il giudizio sull’operato di Felt ad ormai più di quarant’anni dall’evento non si può però non riconoscere che solo quelle rivelazioni e in quella forma permisero all’America di prendere coscienza di una realtà taciuta fin troppo a lungo che neppure il FOIA, il Freedom of Information Act promulgato già nel ’66, era riuscito a rendere così popolare. Il ruolo del whistleblower, della «Gola Profonda», è stato determinante per permettere ai giornalisti di fare con completezza il proprio lavoro e ai cittadini di sapere i dettagli della storia.< Hermes Center for Transparency and Human Rights >seguimi su Twitter | metti Like su Facebook | iscriviti alla mailing listGrazie per aver letto questa storia!

Contributor @HuffingtonPost, @EliteDaily, @Inc, and more.Jan 14, 2015Airbnb Guerilla Usability TestingI ran a usability test with the goal of uncovering pain points in Airbnb’s rental booking process.ObjectiveIdentify pain points in Airbnb’s current rental booking process.Airbnb’s Home PageTarget UsersWorking professionals aged 24–35 who travel frequently for fun and/or for business. Users had either used Airbnb before or considered using Airbnb to book their accommodations.(I defined the target users this way because I had hypothesized that they were the primary demographic to which Airbnb caters. My hypothesis was based on 1) the expected age of the individuals featured in photos on Airbnb’s home page as it’s common for companies to use photos/videos their target audience can relate to, 2) the average age of employees at the corporate companies which have partnered with Airbnb. Airbnb is attempting to formalize business travel by partnering with other technology companies such as Lyft and Evernote — I assumed Airbnb targeted companies to partner with based off of employee demographics, and the average age at these tech companies tend to range from mid twenties to mid thirties).Questions I wanted to answerI wanted to answer two questions:Can users easily search and book a place to stay?Can users identify and use the wish list feature to save rentals for future viewing?TasksUsers were asked to perform the following tasks after I gave them pre-defined scenarios:Search for a rental for a specific date range.Save one rental to their wish list.Select another rental and go through the process of booking it.An example scenario was the following: “Imagine that you’re looking for a rental in San Francisco, CA from Jan 17th to 18th of this year. Go ahead and find a place to stay.” It’s important not to sway the user’s behavior by mentioning key words on the site when explaining a scenario (i.e. “Go ahead and search for a place to stay” would not be ideal because that offers the user additional direction).User FeedbackI gathered and ordered user feedback by the level of frequency of the following type of comments. I grouped the issues in four distinct categories.Organizing Airbnb’s web usability issues by category and frequencyAfter gathering user feedback, I prioritized the issues based on how important I expected them to be to users and to Airbnb’s bottom line.Prioritizing web usability issuesSome Common FindingsBookingUsers expect the reservation to be placed instantaneously when clicking “instant book.”“I’m scared of pressing that button. What exactly will happen afterwards?”After selecting a rental from the search results page, most users were afraid of pressing “Instant Book”Almost every user who wasn’t already familiar with Airbnb’s “instant book” feature was nervous about pressing this button. They didn’t know whether it “immediately” booked the reservation or whether there was another confirmation screen after it.However, I don’t think that this is a bad thing. In my usability test, obviously the users were not actually looking to book a reservation. For real Airbnb users who are looking to book a reservation, I don’t think they would feel any aversion pressing “instant book” if that’s what they wanted to do. Only those who are not serious about instantly booking a reservation would be filtered out, which is most likely what Airbnb wants.Users did not know how to save a rental to view later from the search result screen.“What does the heart icon do? If I click it does that mean I’ll like it on Facebook?”The heart icon allows rentals to be saved for future viewing in a wish list directly from the search results page, but users didn’t figure that out.Almost every user had to select a rental first before seeing a button that explicitly said “Save to Wish List.” Without clicking through, they weren’t able to figure out how to save a particular listing.Users had to select a rental before knowing how to save it for future viewing.Recommendation: While the user hovers over the heart icon before selecting a rental from the search results page, there should be a label that says “Wish List” beside the heart icon.Design SuggestionWith a label by the heart icon that appears as the user hovers over it, there would be one fewer click necessary if the user wants to save a rental to his/her wish list to view later.When the user hovers over the heart icon, a label should indicate the function of it.Implementing the above design could particularly improve the user experience for frequent travelers. For example, if a user is booking a flight to San Francisco, she could easily figure out how to save multiple local rentals to her wish list to make the booking process easier the next time she needs to travel to the area.Airbnb’s site is very well designed. I love the company, and I love UX. I just wanted to see if I could help make it more fun and intuitive to use than it already is!* Though I uncovered a handful of usability concerns in my test, I thought the design suggestion for the wish list feature would be the most impactful towards Airbnb’s bottom line.*I’m not affiliated with Airbnb in any way.DesignUXUX DesignOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Raghav HaranHelping ambitious people build careers they love at http://LandAnyJobYouWant.com.

Example in notes.)ProcessingReviewing notes, identifying the usability issues and prioritizing them:notes on each session. identifying each issue with a post-itbucketing issues by similarity, then naming the buckets. ordering buckets by frequency.Findings: 2 Key IssuesVIEWPORTUsers expect 1-clicking on a thumbnail -> enlarge a thumbnail“My god. How do I look at this?”Every single user’s first interaction in trying to enlarge a photo was to (single) click on a thumbnail. Half of the users never attempted to double-click a thumbnail (the current way to enlarge a photo), and instead went back to the Files page to enlarge a photo file from there.Interactions when attempting to enlarge a photoThe single-click seems to be a valid expectation considering a single-click on items in the “Files” page = enlarges the photo.RECOMMENDATION: Allow users to enlarge a thumbnail in the way they expect to. Redesign the [single-click] action to an [enlarge thumbnail] outcome, and replace the action for the [selection] outcome. Selection via transparent checkboxes is a prevalent design pattern within photo apps.ONBOARDINGUsers think “Photos” is a directory within their Dropbox (but it isn’t)“Where the heck is the upload button?”“It’s terrible. I don’t even know where the album is that I just created.”There’s a few issues in onboarding:Users expect an “Upload” function in the Photos page. In attempting to upload photos, users scan the top nav for an upload button, then click other areas for a resolution (account, settings, and Files directory). It’s not clear to users that “Photos” is not actual Dropbox directory (it’s a visual feed of their photos), and that items therefore can’t be uploaded into it.Interactions when attempting to upload a photoAs a result of failing to upload and enlarge photos, some users were unsure of the benefits of the “Photos” page .Some users also didn’t understand how albums worked. Upon creating one, they checked for that album back in their Files directory—only to find it didn’t exist.“Why are ‘albums’ not actually real!?”RECOMMENDATION: Users need to know that “Photos” is not a real directory, and that albums are not real subdirectories. Tooltips, onboarding modals, or making the correct file structure explicit are possible solutions here.A Design SuggestionUsers want to enlarge a photo with a single click. Users need to know that “Photos” and albums are not real directories. Potential solution?:See below for the anatomy1. Enlarge a thumbnail with a single click2. Select via checkboxes3.

      "Raghav HaranHelping ambitious people build careers they love at http://LandAnyJobYouWant.com. Contributor @HuffingtonPost, @EliteDaily, @Inc, and more.Oct 24, 2015How to Get Any Job You Want (even if you’re unqualified)By Raghav HaranIf I had to describe 3 things about New Yorkers, I’d say:1) they hate tourists2) they hate every other city on the planet3) THEY ALL look good.Maybe it’s just because I’m from the Midwest. But to me, everybody in NYC looks like they go to the gym.I had tried a bunch of times to gain weight previously, but to no avail. Being around all these jacked guys made me want to give it another shot.But I needed to try something different. So last summer, I hired a personal trainer in NYC.This is what I miss most about New York City. No, not the Empire State Building. The Equinox gym.And I was super happy with the results. So happy that I was thinking about maybe getting another trainer in my hometown after I went back.I told my NYC trainer about this. He asked, “Are they professionally certified in strength training and nutrition?”I had no idea.How many people do you know who say “I want to get ripped. I need advice from someone who has certifications in nutrition and strength training!”The only people who say that are the people who have those fancy credentials.The buyers don’t care!They just find the most ripped person they know, and ask THEM what to do.Years ago, I was interviewing for an internship at a startup. I had a good resume, and the people at the company knew I went to a good school. I thought I had the offer in the bag.But I never heard back from them.I found out later that they hired some guy from a random community college in a city I’d never heard of. He didn’t have as much related experience either.How’s that possible?It turns out that people applying for a job care more about their own credentials than the people who are hiring them.This is very counterintuitive.Average applicants obsess over getting the right credentials and being “qualified” on paper. Meanwhile behind the scenes, companies are playing a totally different game.They’re obsessing over finding the right person to solve their problems.Here’s what goes on behind closed doorsCredentials and paper qualifications DO matter for some (mainly academic) industries like medicine or law, but for most other fields, job requirements are surprisingly negotiable.Companies can sometimes get over a hundred applications for a single position, so they need to have some way of weeding people out to keep that number manageable. The best way of doing that is by saying “graduate degree required”, “5+ years of experience required”, etc.What they’re REALLY thinking is “we don’t want to go through a bunch of applications of people who don’t know what they’re doing — a person with 5+ years of experience could most likely do a good job”.If you can prove to them that you can solve their problem, you instantly decommoditize yourself, and none of those things on paper matter as much.This is exactly how I’ve gotten interviews and job offers for positions that require masters degrees, MBAs, degrees in subjects I’ve never studied, and more years of experience than I have.So how do you prove to them that you can solve their problem?Do the job before you get the job.I call this the “pre-interview project”.For example, if you’re applying for a sales/marketing role, a good pre-interview project could be selling some of the company’s products and writing a document about it. If you’re applying for a design related role, you can mockup some new designs for the company and tell them why you made those decisions.Today, I’m going to show you exactly how to choose the perfect pre-interview project (including real life examples), who to send it to within the company you’re applying to, and how to structure the email to so that it’s well received (I’ll even give you sample email templates to use).Let’s get started.Step 1: Narrow in on a few existing jobsThis process is not as quick as sending your resume out a bunch of times, but it is more effective.While everyone else is spamming their resume to a hundred companies just to get a few interviews (if any), you’ll pick just a handful of jobs to apply to and crush them all.First, go on some job boards, and choose 3–5 jobs you’d like to have.Here are some good rules to keep in mind when you’re looking at the requirements on job descriptions:It’s OK if you’re a few years below the minimum experience level, but not TOO far below. If you’re just a college grad, don’t go for senior level jobs that require 7–10+ years of experience. But you CAN go for jobs that require, say, 3–5 years of experience even if you only have 1.It’s OK if your education level is a little below the required amount, but again, not too much below. For example — even though I never went to grad school, I’ve been able to get interviews for internships that required an MBA, and full time jobs that required a masters, but jobs that require PhDs are out of my league.Make sure that you can actually DO the job. You might not need credentials, but you do need the skills to get results.Once you have your 3–5 jobs, move on to step 2.Step 2: Outline what you’ll be doing on the jobBy getting a good understanding of what you’ll be doing everyday on the job, you’ll know exactly what the perfect pre-interview project should be to prove that you’d be the right fit.The only thing you really need at hand to figure this out is the job description.Make a special note of the day to day tasks you can do right away. For example, “analyzing churn data” isn’t something you can immediately do (because you need a good amount of internal information for that) but “form partnerships with local businesses” definitely is something you can help do without already being at the company.Step 3: Do one pre-interview project per companyNow that you know what the company expects you to do day to day, you can actually do it ahead of time and prove to them that you can solve their problems.When I was applying for a business development role for Kiip, I pitched a few companies on forming partnerships with them, and introduced them to the biz dev team. I ended up getting an offer.When I was applying for product development related positions, I ran quick usability tests on companies’ products, documented my process, created some design suggestions and sent it to the head of each design team. Here’s an example of what I did for Airbnb.This sort of thing got me interviews at major tech companies like Quora, and it even led to Shutterstock creating a position specifically for me.My friend Francine Lee did something similar (but MUCH more in depth) for Dropbox, and then got a job there.Francine did a usability test on Dropbox Photos and posted an article about it on Medium.David Rogier wanted a product management position at Evernote, so he interviewed 23 customers and wrote 10 slides about how he could improve the product and sent it to the CEO — the CEO emailed him back in 30 minutes and asked him to come in.Doing a pre-interview project makes you stand out because the secret sauce is hard work. So most people will never do it.Step 4: Send your project inNext, you want to find the right person within the company to send your project to so that it actually gets noticed.If you’re applying to a smaller company, this is pretty straightforward — you can send it to the head of the department you’re interviewing for, or even the CEO. Most people have a personal page online you can reach out through — if not, you can easily guess their work email (it’s usually firstname.lastname@company.com or something like that).Here’s a sample email template you can use:Hi [name],I’m [your name] and I noticed you’re hiring a [position], and I’m interested. I thought it would be helpful for me to [insert a good description of your pre-interview project] to both show my interest and the value I could bring to [company].[Present the project here — if you just did a writeup (i.e. a design suggestion) then a link or image would do. If you pitched businesses for partnerships, ask if the person you’re emailing would like to be introduced, etc]Quick background on me: [insert a quick 2–3 sentence summary of your background as it relates to this job]Thanks so much for your time — hope to hear from you regarding next steps!Best,[your name]If it’s a big company (like Microsoft, Amazon, etc), it gets a bit trickier because not everyone in the same department will know each other (so your doc might not get shared with the right person). In cases like this, I’d suggest waiting until you get an interview, then do your project, and send it to all your interviewers before the interview date. Here’s a sample email script you can use for this situation:Hi [name],[Employee name] mentioned that I’d be chatting with you on [date] as part of my interview for the [position] at [company][Present the project here (insert link, ask if they’d like to be introduced to a potential partner, etc) ]Just thought I’d sent it over now in case you’d like to chat about it during the interview (if you think it would be appropriate, of course).Best,[your name]Every time I’ve done this, my interviews have gone SUPER smoothly and I usually end up getting an offer.“But this won’t work in my field. MY field is different!”No. It’s not.It’s just human behavior. People want their problems solved, and they’re much more likely to hire someone who’s already working on solving them than someone who MIGHT solve them.Try it. It works. And if you are proactive, do a project specifically for a company, and they STILL don’t respond, what does that say about their culture? Then you know that company is not the one you want to work for.It’s a win-win.Want more?Sign up to my private email list, and I’ll send you my 10 step checklist to landing your dream job — even if you feel like you’re “unqualified”, afraid of the unknown, or have no idea what you want to do.Most of my content is different from the usual “career advice.”Sign up here.Job HuntingJobsOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Raghav HaranHelping ambitious people build careers they love at http://LandAnyJobYouWant.com.
